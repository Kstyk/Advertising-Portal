## About the project
The project is a web application addressed both to people looking for contrators and also contractors can look for customers.

Customers of the website have almost 1000 categories at their disposal in which they can add a job to do and search for services from contractors. Easy access to view current orders is the goal of the project. After selecting a contracotr, client can evaluate his work, which may be useful for future interested people to use this contractor's services.

## Summary
This project was my first app wrote in .NET and I'm pretty glad how it looks at the end. Application in ASP.NET is also pretty easy to deploy on Azure - just linking your account on Azure in Visual Studio
and clicking one button to start deploying to earlier created new resource. I created frontend in React - I learnt how to use a new few things during creating this project, like for example creating custom hook to use Axios
and injecting the access token to every request when I needed authentication.
